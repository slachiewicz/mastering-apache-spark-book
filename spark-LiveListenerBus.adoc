== [[LiveListenerBus]] LiveListenerBus

`LiveListenerBus` is used to announce application-wide events in a Spark application. It asynchronously passes <<events, listener events>> to <<spark_extraListeners, registered Spark listeners>>.

.LiveListenerBus, SparkListenerEvents, and Senders

`LiveListenerBus` is a single-JVM link:spark-SparkListenerBus.adoc[SparkListenerBus] that uses <<listenerThread, listenerThread to poll events>>. Emitters are supposed to use <<post, `post` method to post `SparkListenerEvent` events>>.

NOTE: The event queue is http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/LinkedBlockingQueue.html[java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue] with capacity of 10000 `SparkListenerEvent` events.

[[creating-instance]]
[[conf]]
`LiveListenerBus` takes a link:spark-SparkConf.adoc[SparkConf] when created.

`LiveListenerBus` is <<creating-instance, created>> and started when `SparkContext` is link:spark-SparkContext.adoc#listenerBus[initialized].

=== [[start]] Starting `LiveListenerBus` -- `start` method

[source, scala]
----
start(sc: SparkContext): Unit
----

`start` starts <<listenerThread, processing events>>.

Internally, it saves the input `SparkContext` for later use and starts <<listenerThread, listenerThread>>. It makes sure that it only happens when `LiveListenerBus` has not been started before (i.e. `started` is disabled).

If however `LiveListenerBus` has already been started, a `IllegalStateException` is thrown:

```
[name] already started!
```

=== [[post]] Posting SparkListenerEvent Events -- `post` method

[source, scala]
----
post(event: SparkListenerEvent): Unit
----

`post` puts the input `event` onto the internal `eventQueue` queue and releases the internal `eventLock` semaphore. If the event placement was not successful (and it could happen since it is tapped at 10000 events) <<onDropEvent, onDropEvent>> method is called.

The event publishing is only possible when `stopped` flag has been enabled.

CAUTION: FIXME Who's enabling the `stopped` flag and when/why?

If `LiveListenerBus` has been stopped, the following ERROR appears in the logs:

```
ERROR [name] has already stopped! Dropping event [event]
```

=== [[onDropEvent]] Event Dropped Callback -- `onDropEvent` method

[source, scala]
----
onDropEvent(event: SparkListenerEvent): Unit
----

`onDropEvent` is called when no further events can be added to the internal `eventQueue` queue (while <<post, posting a SparkListenerEvent event>>).

It simply prints out the following ERROR message to the logs and ensures that it happens only once.

```
ERROR Dropping SparkListenerEvent because no remaining room in event queue. This likely means one of the SparkListeners is too slow and cannot keep up with the rate at which tasks are being started by the scheduler.
```

NOTE: It uses the internal `logDroppedEvent` atomic variable to track the state.

=== [[stop]] Stopping `LiveListenerBus` -- `stop` method

[source, scala]
----
stop(): Unit
----

`stop` releases the internal `eventLock` semaphore and waits until <<listenerThread, listenerThread>> dies. It can only happen after all events were posted (and polling `eventQueue` gives nothing).

It checks that `started` flag is enabled (i.e. `true`) and throws a `IllegalStateException` otherwise.

```
Attempted to stop [name] that has not yet started!
```

`stopped` flag is enabled.

=== [[listenerThread]] `listenerThread` for Event Polling

`LiveListenerBus` uses link:spark-SparkListenerBus.adoc[SparkListenerBus] single-daemon thread that ensures that the polling events from the event queue is only after <<start, the listener was started>> and only one event at a time.

CAUTION: FIXME There is some logic around no events in the queue.

=== [[addToStatusQueue]] Registering SparkListenerInterface with Application Status Queue -- `addToStatusQueue` Method

[source, scala]
----
addToStatusQueue(listener: SparkListenerInterface): Unit
----

`addToStatusQueue` simply <<addToQueue, adds the SparkListenerInterface>> to <<EVENT_LOG_QUEUE, eventLog>> queue.
