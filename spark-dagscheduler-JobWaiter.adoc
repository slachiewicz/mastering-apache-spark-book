`JobWaiter` is a link:spark-dagscheduler-JobListener.adoc[JobListener] that is used when `DAGScheduler` link:spark-DAGScheduler.adoc#submitJob[submits a job] or link:spark-DAGScheduler.adoc#submitMapStage[submits a map stage].

You can use a `JobWaiter` to block until the job finishes executing or to cancel it.

While the methods execute, link:spark-dagscheduler-DAGSchedulerEventProcessLoop.adoc#JobSubmitted[`JobSubmitted`] and link:spark-dagscheduler-DAGSchedulerEventProcessLoop.adoc#MapStageSubmitted[MapStageSubmitted] events are posted that reference the `JobWaiter`.

As a `JobListener`, `JobWaiter` gets notified about task completions or failures, using `taskSucceeded` and `jobFailed`, respectively. When the total number of tasks (that equals the number of partitions to compute) equals the number of `taskSucceeded`, the `JobWaiter` instance is marked successful. A `jobFailed` event marks the `JobWaiter` instance failed.
