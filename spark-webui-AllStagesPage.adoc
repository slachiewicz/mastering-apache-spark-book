== [[AllStagesPage]] Stages for All Jobs Page

`AllStagesPage` is a web page (section) that is registered with the link:spark-webui-StagesTab.adoc[Stages tab] that <<render, displays all stages in a Spark application>> - active, pending, completed, and failed stages with their count.

[[pool-names]]
In link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulingmode.adoc#FAIR[FAIR scheduling mode] you have access to the table showing the scheduler pools as well as the pool names per stage.

NOTE: Pool names are calculated using link:spark-SparkContext.adoc#getAllPools[SparkContext.getAllPools].

Internally, `AllStagesPage` is a link:spark-webui-WebUIPage.adoc[WebUIPage] with access to the parent link:spark-webui-StagesTab.adoc[Stages tab] and more importantly the link:spark-webui-JobProgressListener.adoc[JobProgressListener] to have access to current state of the entire Spark application.

=== [[render]] Rendering AllStagesPage (render method)

[source, scala]
----
render(request: HttpServletRequest): Seq[Node]
----

`render` generates a HTML page to display in a web browser.

It uses the parent's link:spark-webui-JobProgressListener.adoc[JobProgressListener] to know about:

* active stages (as `activeStages`)
* pending stages (as `pendingStages`)
* completed stages (as `completedStages`)
* failed stages (as `failedStages`)
* the number of completed stages (as `numCompletedStages`)
* the number of failed stages (as `numFailedStages`)

NOTE: Stage information is available as link:spark-dagscheduler-StageInfo.adoc[StageInfo] object.

There are 4 different tables for the different states of stages - active, pending, completed, and failed. They are displayed only when there are stages in a given state.

You could also notice "retry" for stage when it was retried.
