== [[TaskSet]] TaskSet -- Set of Tasks for Single Stage

A *TaskSet* is a collection of tasks that belong to a single link:spark-DAGScheduler-Stage.adoc[stage] and a *stage attempt*. It has also *priority* and *properties* attributes. Priority is used in FIFO scheduling mode (see <<priority-field-fifo-scheduling, Priority Field and FIFO Scheduling>>) while properties are the properties of the first job in the stage.

CAUTION: FIXME Where are `properties` of a TaskSet used?

A TaskSet represents the missing partitions of a stage.

The pair of a stage and a stage attempt uniquely describes a TaskSet and that is what you can see in the logs when a TaskSet is used:

```
TaskSet [stageId].[stageAttemptId]
```

A TaskSet contains a fully-independent sequence of tasks that can run right away based on the data that is already on the cluster, e.g. map output files from previous stages, though it may fail if this data becomes unavailable.

TaskSet can be submitted (consult link:spark-TaskScheduler.adoc#contract[TaskScheduler Contract]).

=== Where TaskSets are used

* link:spark-DAGScheduler.adoc#submitMissingTasks[DAGScheduler.submitMissingTasks]
** `TaskSchedulerImpl.submitTasks`
* `TaskSchedulerImpl.createTaskSetManager`

=== [[priority-field-fifo-scheduling]] Priority Field and FIFO Scheduling

A TaskSet has `priority` field that turns into the *priority* field's value of link:spark-TaskSetManager.adoc[TaskSetManager] (which is a link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc[Schedulable]).

The `priority` field is used in link:spark-taskscheduler-pool.adoc#FIFOSchedulingAlgorithm[FIFOSchedulingAlgorithm] in which equal priorities give stages an advantage (not to say _priority_).

NOTE: `FIFOSchedulingAlgorithm` is only used for `FIFO` scheduling mode in a link:spark-taskscheduler-pool.adoc[Pool] (i.e. a schedulable collection of `Schedulable` objects).

Effectively, the `priority` field is the job's id of the first job this stage was part of (for FIFO scheduling).
