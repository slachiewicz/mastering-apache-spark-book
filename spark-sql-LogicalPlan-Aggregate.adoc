== [[Aggregate]] Aggregate Unary Logical Operator

`Aggregate` is a link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc#UnaryNode[unary logical operator] that holds the following:

* [[groupingExpressions]] Grouping link:spark-sql-Expression.adoc[expressions]
* [[aggregateExpressions]] Aggregate link:spark-sql-Expression.adoc#NamedExpression[named expressions]
* [[child]] Child link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[logical plan]

`Aggregate` is created to represent the following (after a logical plan is link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc#analyzed[analyzed]):

* SQL's link:spark-sql-AstBuilder.adoc#withAggregation[GROUP BY] clause (possibly with `WITH CUBE` or `WITH ROLLUP`)

* link:spark-sql-RelationalGroupedDataset.adoc[RelationalGroupedDataset] aggregations (e.g. link:spark-sql-RelationalGroupedDataset.adoc#pivot[pivot])

* link:spark-sql-KeyValueGroupedDataset.adoc[KeyValueGroupedDataset] aggregations

* `AnalyzeColumnCommand`

NOTE: `Aggregate` logical operator is translated to one of link:spark-sql-SparkPlan-HashAggregateExec.adoc[HashAggregateExec], link:spark-sql-SparkPlan-ObjectHashAggregateExec.adoc[ObjectHashAggregateExec] or link:spark-sql-SparkPlan-SortAggregateExec.adoc[SortAggregateExec] physical operators in link:spark-sql-SparkStrategy-Aggregation.adoc[Aggregation] execution planning strategy.

| Name
| Description

| `maxRows`
a| <<child, Child logical plan>>'s `maxRows`

NOTE: Part of link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc#maxRows[LogicalPlan contract].

| `output`
a| Attributes of <<aggregateExpressions, aggregate named expressions>>

NOTE: Part of link:spark-sql-catalyst-QueryPlan.adoc#output[QueryPlan contract].

| `resolved`
a| Enabled when:

* <<expressions, expressions>> and <<child, child logical plan>> are resolved
* No link:spark-sql-Expression-WindowExpression.adoc[WindowExpressions] exist in <<aggregateExpressions, aggregate named expressions>>

NOTE: Part of link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc#resolved[LogicalPlan contract].

| `validConstraints`
a| The (expression) constraints of <<child, child logical plan>> and non-aggregate <<aggregateExpressions, aggregate named expressions>>.

NOTE: Part of link:spark-sql-catalyst-QueryPlan.adoc#validConstraints[QueryPlan contract].

=== [[computeStats]] `computeStats` Method

CAUTION: FIXME

NOTE: `computeStats` is a part of link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc#computeStats[LogicalPlan Contract] to calculating statistics estimates (for cost-based optimizer).

=== [[optimizer]] Rule-Based Logical Optimization Phase

link:spark-sql-Optimizer-PushDownPredicate.adoc[PushDownPredicate] logical plan optimization applies so-called *filter pushdown* to a link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan-Pivot.adoc[Pivot] operator when under `Filter` operator and with all expressions deterministic.
