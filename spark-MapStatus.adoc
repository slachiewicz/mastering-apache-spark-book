== [[MapStatus]] MapStatus -- Shuffle Map Output Status

`MapStatus` is the link:spark-taskscheduler-ShuffleMapTask.adoc#runTask[result of running a `ShuffleMapTask`] that includes <<contract, information about the `BlockManager` and estimated size of the reduce blocks>>.

There are two types of `MapStatus`:

* *CompressedMapStatus* that compresses the estimated map output size to 8 bits (`Byte`) for efficient reporting.
* *HighlyCompressedMapStatus* that stores the average size of non-empty blocks, and a compressed bitmap for tracking which blocks are empty.

When the number of blocks (the size of `uncompressedSizes`) is greater than *2000*, `HighlyCompressedMapStatus` is chosen.

CAUTION: FIXME What exactly is 2000? Is this the number of tasks in a job?
