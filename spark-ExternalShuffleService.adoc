== [[ExternalShuffleService]] ExternalShuffleService

`ExternalShuffleService` is an *external shuffle service* that serves shuffle blocks from outside an link:spark-Executor.adoc[Executor] process. It runs as a standalone application and manages shuffle output files so they are available for executors at all time. As the shuffle output files are managed externally to the executors it offers an uninterrupted access to the shuffle output files regardless of executors being killed or down.

You start `ExternalShuffleService` using <<start-script, `start-shuffle-service.sh` shell script>> and enable its use by the driver and executors using <<spark.shuffle.service.enabled, spark.shuffle.service.enabled>>.

NOTE: There is a custom external shuffle service for Spark on YARN -- link:yarn/spark-yarn-YarnShuffleService.adoc[YarnShuffleService].

[TIP]
====
Enable `INFO` logging level for `org.apache.spark.deploy.ExternalShuffleService` logger to see what happens inside.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.deploy.ExternalShuffleService=INFO
```

Refer to link:spark-logging.adoc[Logging].
====

=== [[start-script]] `start-shuffle-service.sh` Shell Script

```
start-shuffle-service.sh
```

`start-shuffle-service.sh` shell script allows you to launch `ExternalShuffleService`. The script is under `sbin` directory.

When executed, it runs `sbin/spark-config.sh` and `bin/load-spark-env.sh` shell scripts. It then executes `sbin/spark-daemon.sh` with `start` command and the parameters: `org.apache.spark.deploy.ExternalShuffleService` and `1`.

You can also use link:spark-class.adoc[spark-class] to launch `ExternalShuffleService`.

```
spark-class org.apache.spark.deploy.ExternalShuffleService
```
====

=== [[main]] Launching ExternalShuffleService Standalone Application -- `main` Method

When started, it executes `Utils.initDaemon(log)`.

CAUTION: FIXME `Utils.initDaemon(log)`? See spark-submit.

It loads default Spark properties and creates a `SecurityManager`.

It sets <<spark.shuffle.service.enabled, spark.shuffle.service.enabled>> to `true` (as <<create-instance, later it is checked whether it is enabled or not>>).

A `ExternalShuffleService` is <<create-instance, created>> and <<start, started>>.

A shutdown hook is registered so when `ExternalShuffleService` is shut down, it prints the following INFO message to the logs and the <<stop, stop>> method is executed.

```
INFO ExternalShuffleService: Shutting down shuffle service.
```

[TIP]
====
Enable `DEBUG` logging level for `org.apache.spark.network.shuffle.ExternalShuffleBlockResolver` logger to see what happens inside.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.network.shuffle.ExternalShuffleBlockResolver=DEBUG
```

Refer to link:spark-logging.adoc[Logging].
====

You should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO ExternalShuffleBlockResolver: Registered executor [AppExecId] with [executorInfo]
```

You should also see the following messages when a `SparkContext` is closed:

```
INFO ExternalShuffleBlockResolver: Application [appId] removed, cleanupLocalDirs = [cleanupLocalDirs]
INFO ExternalShuffleBlockResolver: Cleaning up executor [AppExecId]'s [executor.localDirs.length] local dirs
DEBUG ExternalShuffleBlockResolver: Successfully cleaned up directory: [localDir]
```

=== [[creating-instance]] Creating ExternalShuffleService Instance

`ExternalShuffleService` requires a link:spark-SparkConf.adoc[SparkConf] and link:spark-security.adoc[SecurityManager].

When created, it reads <<spark.shuffle.service.enabled,spark.shuffle.service.enabled>> (disabled by default) and <<spark.shuffle.service.port, spark.shuffle.service.port>> (defaults to `7337`) configuration settings. It also checks whether authentication is enabled.

CAUTION: FIXME Review `securityManager.isAuthenticationEnabled()`

It then creates a link:spark-TransportConf.adoc[TransportConf] (as `transportConf`).

It creates a <<ExternalShuffleBlockHandler, ExternalShuffleBlockHandler>> (as `blockHandler`) and `TransportContext` (as `transportContext`).

CAUTION: FIXME TransportContext?

No internal `TransportServer` (as `server`) is created.

=== [[start]] Starting ExternalShuffleService -- `start` Method

[source, scala]
----
start(): Unit
----

`start` starts a `ExternalShuffleService`.

When `start` is executed, you should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO ExternalShuffleService: Starting shuffle service on port [port] with useSasl = [useSasl]
```

If `useSasl` is enabled, a `SaslServerBootstrap` is created.

CAUTION: FIXME SaslServerBootstrap?

The internal `server` reference (a `TransportServer`) is created (which will attempt to bind to `port`).

NOTE: `port` is <<creating-instance, set up by `spark.shuffle.service.port` or defaults to `7337` when `ExternalShuffleService` is created>>.

=== [[stop]] Stopping `ExternalShuffleService` -- `stop` Method

[source, scala]
----
stop(): Unit
----

`stop` closes the internal `server` reference and clears it (i.e. sets it to `null`).

=== [[ExternalShuffleBlockHandler]] ExternalShuffleBlockHandler

`ExternalShuffleBlockHandler` is a `RpcHandler` (i.e. a handler for `sendRPC()` messages sent by ``TransportClient``s).

When created, `ExternalShuffleBlockHandler` requires a link:spark-OneForOneStreamManager.adoc[OneForOneStreamManager] and link:spark-TransportConf.adoc[TransportConf] with a `registeredExecutorFile` to create a `ExternalShuffleBlockResolver`.

It <<ExternalShuffleBlockHandler-handleMessage, handles two `BlockTransferMessage` messages>>: <<ExternalShuffleBlockHandler-OpenBlocks, OpenBlocks>> and <<ExternalShuffleBlockHandler-RegisterExecutor, RegisterExecutor>>.

[TIP]
====
Enable `TRACE` logging level for `org.apache.spark.network.shuffle.ExternalShuffleBlockHandler` logger to see what happens inside.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.network.shuffle.ExternalShuffleBlockHandler=TRACE
```

Refer to link:spark-logging.adoc[Logging].
====

==== [[ExternalShuffleBlockHandler-handleMessage]] `handleMessage` Method

[source, java]
----
handleMessage(
  BlockTransferMessage msgObj,
  TransportClient client,
  RpcResponseCallback callback)
----

`handleMessage` handles two types of `BlockTransferMessage` messages:

* <<ExternalShuffleBlockHandler-OpenBlocks, OpenBlocks>>
* <<ExternalShuffleBlockHandler-RegisterExecutor, RegisterExecutor>>

For any other `BlockTransferMessage` message it throws a `UnsupportedOperationException`:

```
Unexpected message: [msgObj]
```

==== [[ExternalShuffleBlockHandler-OpenBlocks]] OpenBlocks

[source, java]
----
OpenBlocks(String appId, String execId, String[] blockIds)
----

When `OpenBlocks` is received, <<ExternalShuffleBlockHandler-handleMessage, handleMessage>> authorizes the `client`.

CAUTION: FIXME `checkAuth`?

It then <<ExternalShuffleBlockResolver-getBlockData, gets block data>> for each block id in `blockIds` (using <<ExternalShuffleBlockResolver, ExternalShuffleBlockResolver>>).

Finally, it link:spark-OneForOneStreamManager.adoc#registerStream[registers a stream] and does `callback.onSuccess` with a serialized byte buffer (for the `streamId` and the number of blocks in `msg`).

CAUTION: FIXME `callback.onSuccess`?

You should see the following TRACE message in the logs:

```
TRACE Registered streamId [streamId] with [length] buffers for client [clientId] from host [remoteAddress]
```

==== [[ExternalShuffleBlockHandler-RegisterExecutor]] RegisterExecutor

[source, java]
----
RegisterExecutor(String appId, String execId, ExecutorShuffleInfo executorInfo)
----

`RegisterExecutor`

=== [[ExternalShuffleBlockResolver]] ExternalShuffleBlockResolver

CAUTION: FIXME

==== [[ExternalShuffleBlockResolver-getBlockData]] `getBlockData` Method

[source, java]
----
ManagedBuffer getBlockData(String appId, String execId, String blockId)
----

`getBlockData` parses `blockId` (in the format of `shuffle_[shuffleId]\_[mapId]_[reduceId]`) and returns the `FileSegmentManagedBuffer` that corresponds to `shuffle_[shuffleId]_[mapId]_0.data`.

`getBlockData` splits `blockId` to 4 parts using `_` (underscore). It works exclusively with `shuffle` block ids with the other three parts being `shuffleId`, `mapId`, and `reduceId`.

It looks up an executor (i.e. a `ExecutorShuffleInfo` in `executors` private registry) for `appId` and `execId` to search for a link:spark-BlockDataManager.adoc#ManagedBuffer[ManagedBuffer].

The `ManagedBuffer` is indexed using a binary file `shuffle_[shuffleId]\_[mapId]_0.index` (that contains offset and length of the buffer) with a data file being `shuffle_[shuffleId]_[mapId]_0.data` (that is returned as `FileSegmentManagedBuffer`).

It throws a `IllegalArgumentException` for block ids with less than four parts:

```
Unexpected block id format: [blockId]
```

or for non-`shuffle` block ids:

```
Expected shuffle block id, got: [blockId]
```

It throws a `RuntimeException` when no `ExecutorShuffleInfo` could be found.

```
Executor is not registered (appId=[appId], execId=[execId])"
```
