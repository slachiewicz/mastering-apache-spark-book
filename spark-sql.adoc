== Spark SQL -- Batch and Streaming Queries Over Structured Data on Massive Scale

Like Apache Spark in general, *Spark SQL* in particular is all about distributed in-memory computations on massive scale.

The primary difference between Spark SQL's and the "bare" Spark Core's RDD computation models is the framework for loading, querying and persisting structured and semi-structured data using *structured queries* that can be expressed using _good ol'_ *SQL*, *HiveQL* and the custom high-level SQL-like, declarative, type-safe link:spark-sql-Dataset.adoc[Dataset] API called *Structured Query DSL*.

NOTE: Semi- and structured datasets are collections of records that can be described using link:spark-sql-schema.adoc[schema] implicitly or explicitly, respectively.

Spark SQL supports structured queries in *batch* and *streaming* modes (with the latter as a separate module of Spark SQL called link:spark-structured-streaming.adoc[Structured Streaming]).

NOTE: Under the covers, structured queries are automatically compiled into corresponding RDD operations.

Regardless of the query language you choose queries all end up as a link:spark-sql-catalyst.adoc[tree of Catalyst expressions] with link:spark-sql-Optimizer.adoc[further optimizations] along the way to your large distributed data sets.

As of Spark 2.0, Spark SQL is now _de facto_ the primary and feature-rich interface to Spark's underlying in-memory distributed platform (hiding Spark Core's RDDs behind higher-level abstractions).

[source, scala]
----
// Define the schema using a case class
case class Person(name: String, age: Int)

// you could read people from a CSV file
// It's been a while since you saw RDDs, hasn't it?
// Excuse me for bringing you the old past.
import org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD
val peopleRDD: RDD[Person] = sc.parallelize(Seq(Person("Jacek", 10)))

// Convert RDD[Person] to Dataset[Person] and run a query

// Automatic schema inferrence from existing RDDs
scala> val people = peopleRDD.toDS
people: org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[Person] = [name: string, age: int]

// Query for teenagers using Scala Query DSL
scala> val teenagers = people.where('age >= 10).where('age <= 19).select('name).as[String]
teenagers: org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[String] = [name: string]

scala> teenagers.show
+-----+
| name|
+-----+
|Jacek|
+-----+

// You could however want to use good ol' SQL, couldn't you?

// 1. Register people Dataset as a temporary view in Catalog
people.createOrReplaceTempView("people")

// 2. Run SQL query
val teenagers = sql("SELECT * FROM people WHERE age >= 10 AND age <= 19")
scala> teenagers.show
+-----+---+
| name|age|
+-----+---+
|Jacek| 10|
+-----+---+

When the Hive support is enabled, Spark developers can read and write data located in existing Apache Hive deployments using HiveQL.

[source, scala]
----
sql("CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW v1 (key INT, value STRING) USING csv OPTIONS ('path'='people.csv', 'header'='true')")

// Queries are expressed in HiveQL
sql("FROM v1").show

scala> sql("desc EXTENDED v1").show(false)
+----------+---------+-------+
|col_name  |data_type|comment|
+----------+---------+-------+
|# col_name|data_type|comment|
|key       |int      |null   |
|value     |string   |null   |
+----------+---------+-------+

Like SQL and NoSQL databases, Spark SQL offers performance query optimizations using link:spark-sql-Optimizer.adoc[Logical Query Plan Optimizer], link:spark-sql-whole-stage-codegen.adoc[Java code generation] (aka _whole-stage codegen_ that could often be better than your own custom hand-written code!) and link:spark-sql-tungsten.adoc[Tungsten execution engine] with its own link:spark-sql-InternalRow.adoc[Internal Binary Row Format].

Spark SQL introduces a tabular data abstraction called link:spark-sql-Dataset.adoc[Dataset] (that was previously link:spark-sql-DataFrame.adoc[DataFrame]). ``Dataset`` data abstraction is designed to make processing large amount of structured tabular data on Spark infrastructure simpler and faster.

[NOTE]
====
Quoting https://drill.apache.org/[Apache Drill] which applies to Spark SQL perfectly:

> A SQL query engine for relational and NoSQL databases with direct queries on self-describing and semi-structured data in files, e.g. JSON or Parquet, and HBase tables without needing to specify metadata definitions in a centralized store.
====

The following snippet shows a *batch ETL pipeline* to process JSON files and saving their subset as CSVs.

[source, scala]
----
spark.read
  .format("json")
  .load("input-json")
  .select("name", "score")
  .where($"score" > 15)
  .write
  .format("csv")
  .save("output-csv")
----

With link:spark-structured-streaming.adoc[Structured Streaming] feature however, the above static batch query becomes dynamic and continuous paving the way for *continuous applications*.

[source, scala]
----
import org.apache.spark.sql.types._
val schema = StructType(
  StructField("id", LongType, nullable = false) ::
  StructField("name", StringType, nullable = false) ::
  StructField("score", DoubleType, nullable = false) :: Nil)

spark.readStream
  .format("json")
  .schema(schema)
  .load("input-json")
  .select("name", "score")
  .where('score > 15)
  .writeStream
  .format("console")
  .start

// -------------------------------------------
// Batch: 1
// -------------------------------------------
// +-----+-----+
// | name|score|
// +-----+-----+
// |Jacek| 20.5|
// +-----+-----+

As of Spark 2.0, the main data abstraction of Spark SQL is link:spark-sql-Dataset.adoc[Dataset]. It represents a *structured data* which are records with a known schema. This structured data representation `Dataset` enables link:spark-sql-tungsten.adoc[compact binary representation] using compressed columnar format that is stored in managed objects outside JVM's heap. It is supposed to speed computations up by reducing memory usage and GCs.

Spark SQL supports link:spark-sql-Optimizer-PushDownPredicate.adoc[predicate pushdown] to optimize performance of Dataset queries and can also link:spark-sql-Optimizer.adoc[generate optimized code at runtime].

Spark SQL comes with the different APIs to work with:

1. link:spark-sql-Dataset.adoc[Dataset API] (formerly link:spark-sql-DataFrame.adoc[DataFrame API]) with a strongly-typed LINQ-like Query DSL that Scala programmers will likely find very appealing to use.
2. link:spark-structured-streaming.adoc[Structured Streaming API (aka Streaming Datasets)] for continuous incremental execution of structured queries.
3. Non-programmers will likely use SQL as their query language through direct integration with Hive
4. JDBC/ODBC fans can use JDBC interface (through link:spark-sql-thrift-server.adoc[Thrift JDBC/ODBC Server]) and connect their tools to Spark's distributed query engine.

Spark SQL comes with a uniform interface for data access in distributed storage systems like Cassandra or HDFS (Hive, Parquet, JSON) using specialized link:spark-sql-DataFrameReader.adoc[DataFrameReader] and link:spark-sql-DataFrameWriter.adoc[DataFrameWriter] objects.

Spark SQL allows you to execute SQL-like queries on large volume of data that can live in Hadoop HDFS or Hadoop-compatible file systems like S3. It can access data from different data sources - files or tables.

Spark SQL defines the following types of functions:

* link:spark-sql-functions.adoc[standard functions] or link:spark-sql-udfs.adoc[User-Defined Functions (UDFs)] that take values from a single row as input to generate a single return value for every input row.
* link:spark-sql-basic-aggregation.adoc[basic aggregate functions] that operate on a group of rows and calculate a single return value per group.
* link:spark-sql-functions-windows.adoc[window aggregate functions] that operate on a group of rows and calculate a single return value for each row in a group.

There are two supported *catalog* implementations -- `in-memory` (default) and `hive` -- that you can set using link:spark-sql-settings.adoc#spark.sql.catalogImplementation[spark.sql.catalogImplementation] property.

From user@spark:

> If you already loaded csv data into a dataframe, why not register it as a table, and use Spark SQL
to find max/min or any other aggregates? SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM dftable_name ... seems natural.

> you're more comfortable with SQL, it might worth registering this DataFrame as a table and generating SQL query to it (generate a string with a series of min-max calls)

You can parse data from external data sources and let the _schema inferencer_ to deduct the schema.

[source, scala]
----
// Example 1
val df = Seq(1 -> 2).toDF("i", "j")
val query = df.groupBy('i)
  .agg(max('j).as("aggOrdering"))
  .orderBy(sum('j))
  .as[(Int, Int)]
query.collect contains (1, 2) // true

// Example 2
val df = Seq((1, 1), (-1, 1)).toDF("key", "value")
df.createOrReplaceTempView("src")
scala> sql("SELECT IF(a > 0, a, 0) FROM (SELECT key a FROM src) temp").show
+-------------------+
|(IF((a > 0), a, 0))|
+-------------------+
|                  1|
|                  0|
+-------------------+
