== Spark SQL -- Batch and Streaming Queries Over Structured Data on Massive Scale

Like Apache Spark in general, *Spark SQL* in particular is all about distributed in-memory computations on massive scale.

The primary difference between Spark SQL's and the "bare" Spark Core's RDD computation models is the framework for loading, querying and persisting structured and semi-structured data using *structured queries* that can be expressed using _good ol'_ *SQL*, *HiveQL* and the custom high-level SQL-like, declarative, type-safe link:spark-sql-Dataset.adoc[Dataset] API called *Structured Query DSL*.
