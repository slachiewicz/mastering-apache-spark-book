== Spark local (pseudo-cluster)

You can run Spark in *local mode*. In this non-distributed single-JVM deployment mode, Spark spawns all the execution components - link:spark-driver.adoc[driver], link:spark-Executor.adoc[executor], link:local/spark-LocalSchedulerBackend.adoc[LocalSchedulerBackend], and link:spark-master.adoc[master] - in the same single JVM. The default parallelism is the number of threads as specified in the <<masterURL, master URL>>. This is the only mode where a driver is used for execution.

The local mode is very convenient for testing, debugging or demonstration purposes as it requires no earlier setup to launch Spark applications.

This mode of operation is also called  http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#initializing-spark[Spark in-process] or (less commonly) *a local version of Spark*.

`SparkContext.isLocal` returns `true` when Spark runs in local mode.

```
scala> sc.isLocal
res0: Boolean = true
```

link:spark-shell.adoc[Spark shell] defaults to local mode with `local[*]` as the link:spark-deployment-environments.adoc#master-urls[the master URL].

```
scala> sc.master
res0: String = local[*]
```

Tasks are not re-executed on failure in local mode (unless <<masterURL, local-with-retries master URL>> is used).

The link:spark-TaskScheduler.adoc[task scheduler] in local mode works with link:local/spark-LocalSchedulerBackend.adoc[LocalSchedulerBackend] task scheduler backend.

=== [[masterURL]] Master URL

You can run Spark in local mode using `local`, `local[n]` or the most general `local[*]` for link:spark-deployment-environments.adoc#master-urls[the master URL].

The URL says how many threads can be used in total:

* `local` uses 1 thread only.

* `local[n]` uses `n` threads.

* `local[*]` uses as many threads as the number of processors available to the Java virtual machine (it uses https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html#availableProcessors--[Runtime.getRuntime.availableProcessors()] to know the number).

CAUTION: FIXME What happens when there's less cores than `n` in the master URL? It is a question from twitter.

* [[local-with-retries]] `local[N, maxFailures]` (called *local-with-retries*) with `N` being `*` or the number of threads to use (as explained above) and `maxFailures` being the value of link:spark-TaskScheduler.adoc#spark_task_maxFailures[spark.task.maxFailures].

=== [[task-submission]] Task Submission a.k.a. reviveOffers

.TaskSchedulerImpl.submitTasks in local mode
image::images/taskscheduler-submitTasks-local-mode.png[align="center"]

When `ReviveOffers` or `StatusUpdate` messages are received, link:local/spark-LocalEndpoint.adoc[LocalEndpoint] places an offer to `TaskSchedulerImpl` (using `TaskSchedulerImpl.resourceOffers`).

If there is one or more tasks that match the offer, they are launched (using `executor.launchTask` method).

The number of tasks to be launched is controlled by the number of threads as specified in <<masterURL, master URL>>. The executor uses threads to spawn the tasks.
