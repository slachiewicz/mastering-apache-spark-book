== [[TaskLocation]] TaskLocation

`TaskLocation` is a location where a link:spark-taskscheduler-Task.adoc[task] should run.

`TaskLocation` can either be a host alone or a (host, executorID) pair (as <<ExecutorCacheTaskLocation, ExecutorCacheTaskLocation>>).

With `ExecutorCacheTaskLocation` the Spark scheduler prefers to launch the task on the given executor, but the next level of preference is any executor on the same host if this is not possible.

NOTE: `TaskLocation` is a Scala `private[spark] sealed` trait (i.e. all the available implementations of `TaskLocation` trait are in a single Scala file).
