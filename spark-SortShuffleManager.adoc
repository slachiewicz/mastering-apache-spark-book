== [[SortShuffleManager]] SortShuffleManager -- The Default (And Only) Sort-Based Shuffle System

`SortShuffleManager` is the one and only link:spark-ShuffleManager.adoc[ShuffleManager] in Spark with the short name `sort` or `tungsten-sort`.

NOTE: You can use link:spark-ShuffleManager.adoc#spark_shuffle_manager[spark.shuffle.manager] Spark property to activate your own implementation of link:spark-ShuffleManager.adoc#contract[ShuffleManager contract].

CAUTION: FIXME The internal registries

[[internal-registries]]

| Name

| [[numMapsForShuffle]] `numMapsForShuffle`

| [[shuffleBlockResolver]] `shuffleBlockResolver`
| link:spark-IndexShuffleBlockResolver.adoc[IndexShuffleBlockResolver] created when <<creating-instance, SortShuffleManager is created>> and used throughout the lifetime of the owning `SortShuffleManager`.

NOTE: `shuffleBlockResolver` is part of link:spark-ShuffleManager.adoc#shuffleBlockResolver[ShuffleManager contract].

Beside the link:spark-ShuffleManager.adoc#shuffleBlockResolver[uses due to the contract], `shuffleBlockResolver` is used in `unregisterShuffle` and stopped in `stop`.

[TIP]
====
Enable `DEBUG` logging level for `org.apache.spark.shuffle.sort.SortShuffleManager$` logger to see what happens inside.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.shuffle.sort.SortShuffleManager$=DEBUG
```

Refer to link:spark-logging.adoc[Logging].

=== [[unregisterShuffle]] `unregisterShuffle` Method

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[creating-instance]] Creating SortShuffleManager Instance

`SortShuffleManager` takes a link:spark-SparkConf.adoc[SparkConf].

`SortShuffleManager` makes sure that <<spark_shuffle_spill, spark.shuffle.spill>> Spark property is enabled. If not you should see the following WARN message in the logs:

```
WARN SortShuffleManager: spark.shuffle.spill was set to false, but this configuration is ignored as of Spark 1.6+. Shuffle will continue to spill to disk when necessary.
```

`SortShuffleManager` initializes the <<internal-registries, internal registries and counters>>.

NOTE: `SortShuffleManager` is created when link:spark-sparkenv.adoc#ShuffleManager[`SparkEnv` is created] (on the driver and executors) which is at the very beginning of a Spark application's lifecycle.

=== [[registerShuffle]] Creating ShuffleHandle (For ShuffleDependency) -- `registerShuffle` Method

[source, scala]
----
registerShuffle[K, V, C](
  shuffleId: Int,
  numMaps: Int,
  dependency: ShuffleDependency[K, V, C]): ShuffleHandle
----

NOTE: `registerShuffle` is part of link:spark-ShuffleManager.adoc#contract[ShuffleManager contract].

CAUTION: FIXME Copy the conditions

`registerShuffle` returns a new `ShuffleHandle` that can be one of the following:

1. link:spark-BypassMergeSortShuffleHandle.adoc[BypassMergeSortShuffleHandle] (with `ShuffleDependency[K, V, V]`) when <<shouldBypassMergeSort, `shouldBypassMergeSort` condition holds>>.

2. link:spark-SerializedShuffleHandle.adoc[SerializedShuffleHandle] (with `ShuffleDependency[K, V, V]`) when <<canUseSerializedShuffle, `canUseSerializedShuffle` condition holds>>.

3. link:spark-BaseShuffleHandle.adoc[BaseShuffleHandle]

=== [[getWriter]] Selecting ShuffleWriter For ShuffleHandle -- `getWriter` Method

[source, scala]
----
getWriter[K, V](
  handle: ShuffleHandle,
  mapId: Int,
  context: TaskContext): ShuffleWriter[K, V]
----

NOTE: `getWriter` is part of link:spark-ShuffleManager.adoc#contract[`ShuffleManager` contract].

Internally, `getWriter` makes sure that a `ShuffleHandle` is associated with its `numMaps` in <<numMapsForShuffle, `numMapsForShuffle` internal registry>>.

CAUTION: FIXME Associated?! What's that?

NOTE: `getWriter` expects that the input `handle` is of type link:spark-BaseShuffleHandle.adoc[BaseShuffleHandle] (despite the signature that says that it can work with any `ShuffleHandle`). Moreover, `getWriter` further expects that in 2 (out of 3 cases) the input `handle` is a more specialized link:spark-IndexShuffleBlockResolver.adoc[IndexShuffleBlockResolver].

`getWriter` then returns a new `ShuffleWriter` for the input `ShuffleHandle`:

1. link:spark-UnsafeShuffleWriter.adoc[UnsafeShuffleWriter] for link:spark-SerializedShuffleHandle.adoc[SerializedShuffleHandle].

2. link:spark-BypassMergeSortShuffleWriter.adoc[BypassMergeSortShuffleWriter] for link:spark-BypassMergeSortShuffleHandle.adoc[BypassMergeSortShuffleHandle].

3. link:spark-SortShuffleWriter.adoc[SortShuffleWriter] for link:spark-BaseShuffleHandle.adoc[BaseShuffleHandle].

=== [[getReader]] Creating BlockStoreShuffleReader For ShuffleHandle -- `getReader` Method

[source, scala]
----
getReader[K, C](
  handle: ShuffleHandle,
  startPartition: Int,
  endPartition: Int,
  context: TaskContext): ShuffleReader[K, C]
----

NOTE: `getReader` is part of link:spark-ShuffleManager.adoc#contract[`ShuffleManager` contract].

`getReader` returns a new link:spark-BlockStoreShuffleReader.adoc[BlockStoreShuffleReader] passing all the input parameters on to it.

NOTE: `getReader` assumes that the input `ShuffleHandle` is of type link:spark-BaseShuffleHandle.adoc[BaseShuffleHandle].

=== [[stop]] Stopping SortShuffleManager -- `stop` Method

[source, scala]
----
stop(): Unit
----

NOTE: `stop` is part of link:spark-ShuffleManager.adoc#stop[ShuffleManager contract].

`stop` link:spark-IndexShuffleBlockResolver.adoc#stop[stops `IndexShuffleBlockResolver`] (available as <<shuffleBlockResolver, shuffleBlockResolver>> internal reference).

=== [[shouldBypassMergeSort]] Considering BypassMergeSortShuffleHandle for ShuffleHandle -- `shouldBypassMergeSort` Method

[source, scala]
----
shouldBypassMergeSort(conf: SparkConf, dep: ShuffleDependency[_, _, _]): Boolean
----

`shouldBypassMergeSort` holds (i.e. is positive) when:

1. The input link:spark-rdd-ShuffleDependency.adoc[ShuffleDependency] has link:spark-rdd-ShuffleDependency.adoc#mapSideCombine[`mapSideCombine` flag enabled] and link:spark-rdd-ShuffleDependency.adoc#aggregator[`aggregator` defined].

2. `mapSideCombine` flag is disabled (i.e. `false`) but the link:spark-rdd-ShuffleDependency.adoc#partitioner[number of partitions (of the `Partitioner` of the input `ShuffleDependency`)] is at most <<spark_shuffle_sort_bypassMergeThreshold, spark.shuffle.sort.bypassMergeThreshold>> Spark property (which defaults to `200`).

Otherwise, `shouldBypassMergeSort` does not hold (i.e. `false`).

NOTE: `shouldBypassMergeSort` is exclusively used when <<registerShuffle, `SortShuffleManager` selects a `ShuffleHandle`>> (for a `ShuffleDependency`).

=== [[canUseSerializedShuffle]] Considering SerializedShuffleHandle for ShuffleHandle -- `canUseSerializedShuffle` Method

[source, scala]
----
canUseSerializedShuffle(dependency: ShuffleDependency[_, _, _]): Boolean
----

`canUseSerializedShuffle` condition holds (i.e. is positive) when all of the following hold (checked in that order):

1. The link:spark-Serializer.adoc#supportsRelocationOfSerializedObjects[`Serializer` of the input `ShuffleDependency` supports relocation of serialized objects].

2. The link:spark-rdd-ShuffleDependency.adoc#aggregator[`Aggregator` of the input `ShuffleDependency` is _not_ defined].

3. The link:spark-rdd-ShuffleDependency.adoc#partitioner[number of shuffle output partitions of the input `ShuffleDependency`] is at most the supported maximum number (which is `(1 << 24) - 1`, i.e. `16777215`).

You should see the following DEBUG message in the logs when `canUseSerializedShuffle` holds:

```
DEBUG Can use serialized shuffle for shuffle [id]
```

Otherwise, `canUseSerializedShuffle` does not hold and you should see one of the following DEBUG messages:

```
DEBUG Can't use serialized shuffle for shuffle [id] because the serializer, [name], does not support object relocation

DEBUG SortShuffleManager: Can't use serialized shuffle for shuffle [id] because an aggregator is defined

DEBUG Can't use serialized shuffle for shuffle [id] because it has more than [number] partitions
```

NOTE: `canUseSerializedShuffle` is exclusively used when <<registerShuffle, `SortShuffleManager` selects a `ShuffleHandle`>> (for a `ShuffleDependency`).

=== [[settings]] Settings

.Spark Properties
[cols="1,1,2",options="header",width="100%"]
|===
| Spark Property
| Default Value
| Description

| [[spark_shuffle_sort_bypassMergeThreshold]] `spark.shuffle.sort.bypassMergeThreshold`
| `200`
| The maximum number of reduce partitions below which `SortShuffleManager` avoids merge-sorting data if there is no map-side aggregation either.

| [[spark_shuffle_spill]] `spark.shuffle.spill`
| `true`
| No longer in use.

When `false` the following WARN shows in the logs when <<creating-instance, `SortShuffleManager` is created>>:

`WARN SortShuffleManager: spark.shuffle.spill was set to false, but this configuration is ignored as of Spark 1.6+. Shuffle will continue to spill to disk when necessary.`
