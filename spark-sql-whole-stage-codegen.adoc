== Whole-Stage Java Code Generation (aka Whole-Stage CodeGen)

NOTE: Review https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12795[SPARK-12795 Whole stage codegen] to learn about the work to support it.

*Whole-Stage Code Generation* (aka _Whole-Stage CodeGen_) fuses multiple operators (as a subtree of plans that link:spark-sql-CodegenSupport.adoc[support code generation]) together into a single Java function that is aimed at improving execution performance. It collapses a query into a single optimized function that eliminates virtual function calls and leverages CPU registers for intermediate data.

NOTE: Whole-Stage Code Generation is enabled by default (using link:spark-sql-SQLConf.adoc#spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage[spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage] property).

NOTE: Whole stage codegen is used by some modern massively parallel processing (MPP) databases to archive great performance. See http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol4/p539-neumann.pdf[Efficiently Compiling Efficient Query Plans for Modern Hardware (PDF)].

NOTE: Janino is used to compile a Java source code into a Java class.

Before a query is executed, link:spark-sql-CollapseCodegenStages.adoc[CollapseCodegenStages] physical preparation rule is used to find the plans that support codegen and collapse them together as `WholeStageCodegen`. It is part of the sequence of rules link:spark-sql-QueryExecution.adoc#preparations[QueryExecution.preparations] that will be applied in order to the physical plan before execution.

=== [[BenchmarkWholeStageCodegen]] BenchmarkWholeStageCodegen -- Performance Benchmark

`BenchmarkWholeStageCodegen` class provides a benchmark to measure whole stage codegen performance.

You can execute it using the command:

```
build/sbt 'sql/testOnly *BenchmarkWholeStageCodegen'
```

NOTE: You need to un-ignore tests in `BenchmarkWholeStageCodegen` by replacing `ignore` with `test`.

```
$ build/sbt 'sql/testOnly *BenchmarkWholeStageCodegen'
...
