== Driver

A *Spark driver* (_aka_ *an application's driver process*) is a JVM process that hosts link:spark-SparkContext.adoc[SparkContext] for a Spark application. It is the master node in a Spark application.

It is the cockpit of jobs and tasks execution (using link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc[DAGScheduler] and link:spark-TaskScheduler.adoc[Task Scheduler]). It hosts link:spark-webui.adoc[Web UI] for the environment.

.Driver with the services

It splits a Spark application into tasks and schedules them to run on executors.

A driver is where the task scheduler lives and spawns tasks across workers.

A driver coordinates workers and overall execution of tasks.

NOTE: link:spark-shell.adoc[Spark shell] is a Spark application and the driver. It creates a `SparkContext` that is available as `sc`.

Driver requires the additional services (beside the common ones like link:spark-ShuffleManager.adoc[ShuffleManager], link:spark-MemoryManager.adoc[MemoryManager], link:spark-blocktransferservice.adoc[BlockTransferService], link:spark-service-broadcastmanager.adoc[BroadcastManager], link:spark-cachemanager.adoc[CacheManager]):

* Listener Bus
* link:spark-rpc.adoc[RPC Environment]
* link:spark-service-MapOutputTrackerMaster.adoc[MapOutputTrackerMaster] with the name *MapOutputTracker*
* link:spark-BlockManagerMaster.adoc[BlockManagerMaster] with the name *BlockManagerMaster*
* link:spark-http-file-server.adoc[HttpFileServer]
* link:spark-metrics-MetricsSystem.adoc[MetricsSystem] with the name *driver*
* link:spark-service-outputcommitcoordinator.adoc[OutputCommitCoordinator] with the endpoint's name *OutputCommitCoordinator*

CAUTION: FIXME Diagram of RpcEnv for a driver (and later executors). Perhaps it should be in the notes about RpcEnv?

* High-level control flow of work
* Your Spark application runs as long as the Spark driver.
** Once the driver terminates, so does your Spark application.
* Creates `SparkContext`, `RDD`'s, and executes transformations and actions
* Launches link:spark-taskscheduler-tasks.adoc[tasks]

=== [[driver-memory]] Driver's Memory

It can be set first using link:spark-submit.adoc#command-line-options[spark-submit's `--driver-memory`] command-line option or <<spark_driver_memory, spark.driver.memory>> and falls back to link:spark-submit.adoc#environment-variables[SPARK_DRIVER_MEMORY] if not set earlier.

NOTE: It is printed out to the standard error output in link:spark-submit.adoc#verbose-mode[spark-submit's verbose mode].

=== [[driver-memory]] Driver's Cores

It can be set first using link:spark-submit.adoc#driver-cores[spark-submit's `--driver-cores`] command-line option for link:spark-deploy-mode.adoc#cluster[`cluster` deploy mode].

NOTE: In link:spark-deploy-mode.adoc#client[`client` deploy mode] the driver's memory corresponds to the memory of the JVM process the Spark application runs on.

NOTE: It is printed out to the standard error output in link:spark-submit.adoc#verbose-mode[spark-submit's verbose mode].

.Spark Properties
[cols="1,1,2",options="header",width="100%"]
|===
| Spark Property | Default Value | Description
| [[spark_driver_blockManager_port]] `spark.driver.blockManager.port` | link:spark-blockmanager.adoc#spark_blockManager_port[spark.blockManager.port] | Port to use for the link:spark-blockmanager.adoc[BlockManager] on the driver.

More precisely, `spark.driver.blockManager.port` is used when link:spark-SparkEnv.adoc#NettyBlockTransferService[`NettyBlockTransferService` is created] (while `SparkEnv` is created for the driver).

| [[spark_driver_host]][[spark.driver.host]] `spark.driver.host`
| link:spark-SparkContext-creating-instance-internals.adoc#localHostName[localHostName]
| The address of the node where the driver runs on.

Set when link:spark-SparkContext.adoc#creating-instance[`SparkContext` is created]

| [[spark_driver_port]][[spark.driver.port]] `spark.driver.port`
| `0`
| The port the driver listens to. It is first set to `0` in the driver when link:spark-SparkContext.adoc#creating-instance[SparkContext is initialized].

Set to the port of link:spark-rpc.adoc[RpcEnv] of the driver (in <<create, SparkEnv.create>>) or when link:yarn/spark-yarn-applicationmaster.adoc#waitForSparkDriver[client-mode `ApplicationMaster` connected to the driver] (in Spark on YARN).

| [[spark_driver_memory]] `spark.driver.memory` | `1g` | The driver's memory size (in MiBs).

Refer to <<driver-memory, Driver's Memory>>.

| [[spark_driver_cores]] `spark.driver.cores` | `1` | The number of CPU cores assigned to the driver in link:spark-deploy-mode.adoc#cluster[cluster deploy mode].

NOTE: When link:yarn/spark-yarn-client.adoc#creating-instance[Client is created] (for Spark on YARN in cluster mode only), it sets the number of cores for `ApplicationManager` using `spark.driver.cores`.

Refer to <<driver-cores, Driver's Cores>>.

| [[spark_driver_extraLibraryPath]] `spark.driver.extraLibraryPath` | |

| [[spark_driver_extraJavaOptions]] `spark.driver.extraJavaOptions` | | Additional JVM options for the driver.

| [[spark.driver.appUIAddress]] spark.driver.appUIAddress

`spark.driver.appUIAddress` is used exclusively in link:yarn/README.adoc[Spark on YARN]. It is set when link:yarn/spark-yarn-client-yarnclientschedulerbackend.adoc#start[YarnClientSchedulerBackend starts] to link:yarn/spark-yarn-applicationmaster.adoc#runExecutorLauncher[run ExecutorLauncher] (and link:yarn/spark-yarn-applicationmaster.adoc#registerAM[register ApplicationMaster] for the Spark application).

| [[spark_driver_libraryPath]] `spark.driver.libraryPath` | |

|===

==== [[spark_driver_extraClassPath]] spark.driver.extraClassPath

`spark.driver.extraClassPath` system property sets the additional classpath entries (e.g. jars and directories) that should be added to the driver's classpath in link:spark-deploy-mode.adoc#cluster[`cluster` deploy mode].

[NOTE]
====
For link:spark-deploy-mode.adoc#client[`client` deploy mode] you can use a properties file or command line to set `spark.driver.extraClassPath`.

Do not use link:spark-SparkConf.adoc[SparkConf] since it is too late for `client` deploy mode given the JVM has already been set up to start a Spark application.

Refer to link:spark-class.adoc#buildSparkSubmitCommand[`buildSparkSubmitCommand` Internal Method] for the very low-level details of how it is handled internally.
====

`spark.driver.extraClassPath` uses a OS-specific path separator.

NOTE: Use ``spark-submit``'s link:spark-submit.adoc#driver-class-path[`--driver-class-path` command-line option] on command line to override `spark.driver.extraClassPath` from a link:spark-properties.adoc#spark-defaults-conf[Spark properties file].
