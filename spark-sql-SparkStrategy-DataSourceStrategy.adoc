== [[DataSourceStrategy]] DataSourceStrategy Execution Planning Strategy

`DataSourceStrategy` is an link:spark-sql-SparkStrategy.adoc[execution planning strategy] (of link:spark-sql-SparkPlanner.adoc[SparkPlanner]) that converts link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan-LogicalRelation.adoc[LogicalRelation] logical operator to link:spark-sql-SparkPlan-RowDataSourceScanExec.adoc[RowDataSourceScanExec] physical operator.

.DataSourceStrategy's Selection Requirements (in execution order)
[cols="1,2",options="header",width="100%"]
|===
| Logical Operator
| Selection Requirements

| `LogicalRelation` with `CatalystScan` relation
| Uses <<pruneFilterProjectRaw, pruneFilterProjectRaw>>

`CatalystScan` does not seem to be used in Spark SQL.

| `LogicalRelation` with `PrunedFilteredScan` relation
| Uses <<pruneFilterProjectRaw, pruneFilterProjectRaw>>

Matches `JDBCRelation` exclusively (as it is `PrunedFilteredScan`)

| `LogicalRelation` with `PrunedScan` relation
| Uses <<pruneFilterProjectRaw, pruneFilterProjectRaw>>

`PrunedScan` does not seem to be used in Spark SQL.

| `LogicalRelation` with `TableScan` relation
| Matches `KafkaRelation` exclusively (as it is `TableScan`)
|===

NOTE: `DataSourceStrategy` uses link:spark-sql-SparkStrategy-FileSourceStrategy.adoc#PhysicalOperation[PhysicalOperation] to destructure a link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[logical plan].

=== [[pruneFilterProjectRaw]] Creating RowDataSourceScanExec (under FilterExec and ProjectExec) -- `pruneFilterProjectRaw` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
pruneFilterProjectRaw(
  relation: LogicalRelation,
  projects: Seq[NamedExpression],
  filterPredicates: Seq[Expression],
  scanBuilder: (Seq[Attribute], Seq[Expression], Seq[Filter]) => RDD[InternalRow]): SparkPlan
----

`pruneFilterProjectRaw` creates a link:spark-sql-SparkPlan-RowDataSourceScanExec.adoc[RowDataSourceScanExec] (possibly as a child of `FilterExec` that in turn could be a child of `ProjectExec`).

NOTE: `pruneFilterProjectRaw` is used when `DataSourceStrategy` <<apply, executes>> (and selects `RowDataSourceScanExec` per `LogicalRelation`).
