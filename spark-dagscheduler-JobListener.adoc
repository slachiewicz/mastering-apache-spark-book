== [[JobListener]] JobListener

Spark subscribes for job completion or failure events (after submitting a job to link:spark-DAGScheduler.adoc[DAGScheduler]) using `JobListener` trait.

The following are the job listeners used:

1. link:spark-dagscheduler-JobWaiter.adoc[JobWaiter]  waits until link:spark-DAGScheduler.adoc[DAGScheduler] completes a job and passes the results of tasks to a `resultHandler` function.
2. `ApproximateActionListener`...FIXME

An instance of `JobListener` is used in the following places:

* In `ActiveJob` as a listener to notify if tasks in this job finish or the job fails.
* In `JobSubmitted`

=== [[contract]][[taskSucceeded]][[jobFailed]] `JobListener` Contract

`JobListener` is a `private[spark]` contract with the following two methods:

[source, scala]
----
private[spark] trait JobListener {
  def taskSucceeded(index: Int, result: Any)
  def jobFailed(exception: Exception)
}
----

A `JobListener` object is notified each time a task succeeds (by `taskSucceeded`) and when the whole job fails (by `jobFailed`).
