== [[InputAdapter]] InputAdapter Unary Physical Operator

`InputAdapter` is a link:spark-sql-SparkPlan.adoc#UnaryExecNode[unary physical operator] (i.e. with one <<child, child>> physical operator) that is an adapter to link:spark-sql-CodegenSupport.adoc[generate code] for the single child operator that does not support link:spark-sql-whole-stage-codegen.adoc[Java code generation] (aka _whole-stage codegen_) but participates in such code generation for a structured query.

`InputAdapter` is created exclusively when `CollapseCodegenStages` link:spark-sql-CollapseCodegenStages.adoc#insertInputAdapter[inserts a WholeStageCodegenExec operator] into a physical plan.

[[generateTreeString]]
`InputAdapter` removes the star from a stringified tree representation of a physical plan (that link:spark-sql-SparkPlan-WholeStageCodegenExec.adoc[WholeStageCodegenExec] adds), e.g. for link:spark-sql-dataset-operators.adoc#explain[explain] operator.

=== [[doProduce]] Generating Java Source Code -- `doProduce` Method

doProduce(ctx: CodegenContext): String

NOTE: `doProduce` is a part of link:spark-sql-CodegenSupport.adoc#doProduce[CodegenSupport Contract] to generate a Java source code for...FIXME

`doProduce` generates a Java source code that consumes link:spark-sql-InternalRow.adoc[internal row] of a single input `RDD` one at a time (in a `while` loop).

NOTE: `doProduce` supports one input RDD only (that the single child generates when link:spark-sql-SparkPlan.adoc#execute[executed]).

Internally, `doProduce` generates two terms `input` and `row` and uses the code from link:spark-sql-CodegenSupport.adoc#consume[consume] code generator.
