== [[ShuffleBlockResolver]] ShuffleBlockResolver Contract

`ShuffleBlockResolver` is the <<contract, abstraction>> of <<implementations, shuffle block resolvers>> that <<spark-BlockManager.adoc#, BlockManager>> uses to <<getBlockData, retrieve a shuffle block data>> for a logical shuffle block identifier (i.e. map, reduce, and shuffle).

NOTE: Shuffle block data files are often referred to as *map outputs files*.
