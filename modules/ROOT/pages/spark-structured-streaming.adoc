== Spark Structured Streaming -- Streaming Datasets

*Spark Structured Streaming* is a new computation model introduced in Spark 2.0 for building end-to-end streaming applications termed as *continuous applications*.

Structured streaming offers a high-level declarative streaming API built on top of link:spark-sql-Dataset.adoc[Datasets] (inside Spark SQL's engine) for continuous incremental execution of structured queries.

TIP: You can find more information about Spark Structured Streaming in my separate notebook titled  https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/spark-structured-streaming[Spark Structured Streaming].
