== [[BlockInfo]] BlockInfo -- Metadata of Memory Block

`BlockInfo` is a metadata of <<BlockId, memory block>> (aka _memory page_) -- the memory block's <<size, size>>, the <<readerCount, number of readers>> and the <<writerTask, id of the writer task>>.

`BlockInfo` has a link:spark-rdd-StorageLevel.adoc[StorageLevel], `ClassTag` and `tellMaster` flag.

=== [[size]] Size -- `size` Attribute

`size` attribute is the size of the memory block. It starts with `0`.

It represents the number of bytes that link:spark-BlockManager.adoc#putBytes[`BlockManager` saved] or link:spark-BlockManager.adoc#doPutIterator[BlockManager.doPutIterator].

=== [[readerCount]] Reader Count -- `readerCount` Counter

`readerCount` counter is the number of readers of the memory block, i.e. the number of read locks. It starts with `0`.

`readerCount` is incremented when a link:spark-BlockInfoManager.adoc#lockForReading[read lock is acquired] and decreases when the following happens:

* The link:spark-BlockManager.adoc#unlock[memory block is unlocked]

* link:spark-BlockInfoManager.adoc#releaseAllLocksForTask[All locks for the memory block obtained by a task are released].

* The link:spark-BlockInfoManager.adoc#removeBlock[memory block is removed]

* link:spark-BlockInfoManager.adoc#clear[Clearing the current state of `BlockInfoManager`].

=== [[writerTask]] Writer Task -- `writerTask` Attribute

`writerTask` attribute is the task that owns the write lock for the memory block.

A writer task can be one of the three possible identifiers:

* [[NO_WRITER]] `NO_WRITER` (i.e. `-1`) to denote no writers and hence no write lock in use.

* [[NON_TASK_WRITER]] `NON_TASK_WRITER` (i.e. `-1024`) for non-task threads, e.g. by a driver thread or by unit test code.

* the task attempt id of the task which currently holds the write lock for this block.

The writer task is assigned in the following scenarios:

* A link:spark-BlockInfoManager.adoc#lockForWriting[write lock is requested for a memory block (with no writer and readers)]

* A link:spark-BlockInfoManager.adoc#unlock[memory block is unlocked]

* link:spark-BlockInfoManager.adoc#releaseAllLocksForTask[All locks obtained by a task are released]

* A link:spark-BlockInfoManager.adoc#removeBlock[memory block is removed]

* link:spark-BlockInfoManager.adoc#clear[Clearing the current state of `BlockInfoManager`].
