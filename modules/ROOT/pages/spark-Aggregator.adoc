== [[Aggregator]] Map/Reduce-side Aggregator

`Aggregator` is a set of functions used to aggregate distributed data sets:

[source, scala]
----
createCombiner: V => C
mergeValue: (C, V) => C
mergeCombiners: (C, C) => C
----

NOTE: `Aggregator` is created in link:spark-rdd-PairRDDFunctions.adoc#combineByKeyWithClassTag[`combineByKeyWithClassTag` transformations] to link:spark-rdd-ShuffledRDD.adoc[create `ShuffledRDDs`] and is eventually passed on to link:spark-rdd-ShuffleDependency.adoc#aggregator[ShuffleDependency]. It is also used in link:spark-ExternalSorter.adoc[ExternalSorter].
