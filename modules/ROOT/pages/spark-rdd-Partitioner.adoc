== [[Partitioner]] Partitioner

CAUTION: FIXME

`Partitioner` captures data distribution at the output. A scheduler can optimize future operations based on this.

`val partitioner: Option[Partitioner]` specifies how the RDD is partitioned.

The contract of partitioner ensures that records for a given key have to reside on a single partition.
