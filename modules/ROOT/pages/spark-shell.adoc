== [[spark-shell]] Spark Shell -- spark-shell shell script

*Spark shell* is an interactive environment where you can learn how to make the most out of Apache Spark quickly and conveniently.

TIP: Spark shell is particularly helpful for fast interactive prototyping.

Under the covers, Spark shell is a standalone Spark application written in Scala that offers environment with auto-completion (using `TAB` key) where you can run ad-hoc queries and get familiar with the features of Spark (that help you in developing your own standalone Spark applications). It is a very convenient tool to explore the many things available in Spark with immediate feedback. It is one of the many reasons why link:spark-overview.adoc#why-spark[Spark is so helpful for tasks to process datasets of any size].

There are variants of Spark shell for different languages: `spark-shell` for Scala, `pyspark` for Python and `sparkR` for R.

NOTE: This document (and the book in general) uses `spark-shell` for Scala only.

You can start Spark shell using <<using-spark-shell, `spark-shell` script>>.

```
$ ./bin/spark-shell
scala>
```

`spark-shell` is an extension of Scala REPL with automatic instantiation of link:spark-sql-SparkSession.adoc[SparkSession] as `spark` (and link:spark-SparkContext.adoc[SparkContext] as `sc`).

[source, scala]
----
scala> :type spark
org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession

// Learn the current version of Spark in use
scala> spark.version
res0: String = 2.1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

`spark-shell` also imports link:spark-sql-SparkSession.adoc#implicits[Scala SQL's implicits] and link:spark-sql-SparkSession.adoc#sql[`sql` method].

[source, scala]
----
scala> :imports
 1) import spark.implicits._       (59 terms, 38 are implicit)
 2) import spark.sql               (1 terms)
----

[NOTE]
====
When you execute `spark-shell` you actually execute link:spark-submit.adoc[Spark submit] as follows:

[options="wrap"]
----
org.apache.spark.deploy.SparkSubmit --class org.apache.spark.repl.Main --name Spark shell spark-shell
----

Set `SPARK_PRINT_LAUNCH_COMMAND` to see the entire command to be executed. Refer to link:spark-tips-and-tricks.adoc#SPARK_PRINT_LAUNCH_COMMAND[Print Launch Command of Spark Scripts].

=== [[using-spark-shell]] Using Spark shell

You start Spark shell using `spark-shell` script (available in `bin` directory).

```
$ ./bin/spark-shell
Setting default log level to "WARN".
To adjust logging level use sc.setLogLevel(newLevel). For SparkR, use setLogLevel(newLevel).

Spark shell creates an instance of link:spark-sql-SparkSession.adoc[SparkSession] under the name `spark` for you (so you don't have to know the details how to do it yourself on day 1).

```
scala> :type spark
org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession
```

Besides, there is also `sc` value created which is an instance of link:spark-SparkContext.adoc[SparkContext].

```
scala> :type sc
org.apache.spark.SparkContext
```

To close Spark shell, you press `Ctrl+D` or type in `:q` (or any subset of `:quit`).

```
scala> :q
```

Enable `INFO` logging level for link:spark-Executor.adoc[org.apache.spark.executor.Executor] logger to have the value printed out to the logs:
