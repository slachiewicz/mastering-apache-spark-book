=== [[deserialize]] `deserialize` Method

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[supportsRelocationOfSerializedObjects]] `supportsRelocationOfSerializedObjects` Property

`supportsRelocationOfSerializedObjects` should be enabled (i.e. true) only when reordering the bytes of serialized objects in serialization stream output is equivalent to having re-ordered those elements prior to serializing them.

`supportsRelocationOfSerializedObjects` is disabled (i.e. `false`) by default.

NOTE: `KryoSerializer` uses `autoReset` for `supportsRelocationOfSerializedObjects`.

NOTE: `supportsRelocationOfSerializedObjects` is enabled in `UnsafeRowSerializer`.
