= [[Executor]] Executor

`Executor` is a distributed agent that is responsible for executing <<spark-scheduler-Task.adoc#, tasks>>.

`Executor` is created when:

* `CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend` <<spark-CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend.adoc#RegisteredExecutor, receives `RegisteredExecutor` message>> (for Spark Standalone and YARN)

* Spark on Mesos's `MesosExecutorBackend` is requested to xref:spark-on-mesos:spark-executor-backends-MesosExecutorBackend.adoc#registered[registered]

* xref:spark-local:spark-LocalEndpoint.adoc[LocalEndpoint] is created (for local mode)

`Executor` _typically_ runs for the entire lifetime of a Spark application which is called *static allocation of executors* (but you could also opt in for <<spark-dynamic-allocation.adoc#, dynamic allocation>>).

NOTE: Executors are managed exclusively by <<spark-ExecutorBackend.adoc#, executor backends>>.

Executors <<startDriverHeartbeater, reports heartbeat and partial metrics for active tasks>> to the <<heartbeatReceiverRef, HeartbeatReceiver RPC Endpoint>> on the driver.

Executors provide in-memory storage for RDDs that are cached in Spark applications (via <<spark-BlockManager.adoc#, Block Manager>>).

When started, an executor first registers itself with the driver that establishes a communication channel directly to the driver to accept tasks for execution.

image::executor-taskrunner-executorbackend.png[align="center"]

*Executor offers* are described by executor id and the host on which an executor runs (see <<resource-offers, Resource Offers>> in this document).

Executors can run multiple tasks over its lifetime, both in parallel and sequentially. They track <<spark-Executor-TaskRunner.adoc#, running tasks>> (by their task ids in <<runningTasks, runningTasks>> internal registry). Consult <<launchTask, Launching Tasks>> section.

Executors use a <<threadPool, Executor task launch worker thread pool>> for <<launchTask, launching tasks>>.

Executors send <<metrics, metrics>> (and heartbeats) using the <<heartbeater, internal heartbeater - Heartbeat Sender Thread>>.

It is recommended to have as many executors as data nodes and as many cores as you can get from the cluster.

Executors are described by their *id*, *hostname*, *environment* (as `SparkEnv`), and *classpath* (and, less importantly, and more for internal optimization, whether they run in <<local/spark-local.adoc#, local>> or <<spark-cluster.adoc#, cluster>> mode).

[TIP]
====
Enable `ALL` logging level for `org.apache.spark.executor.Executor` logger to see what happens inside.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.executor.Executor=ALL
```

Refer to <<spark-logging.adoc#, Logging>>.

== [[creating-instance]] Creating Executor Instance

`Executor` takes the following to be created:

* [[executorId]] Executor ID
* [[executorHostname]] Host name
* [[env]] <<spark-SparkEnv.adoc#, SparkEnv>>
* [[userClassPath]] User-defined jars (`Seq[URL]` / default: `Nil`)
* [[isLocal]] Flag to control whether the executor runs in local or cluster mode (default: `false`)
* [[uncaughtExceptionHandler]] Java's `UncaughtExceptionHandler` (default: `SparkUncaughtExceptionHandler`)

NOTE: User-defined JARs are defined using <<spark-CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend.adoc#main, --user-class-path>> command-line option of `CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend` that can be set using <<spark-configuration-properties.adoc#spark.executor.extraClassPath, spark.executor.extraClassPath>> property.

NOTE: `isLocal` is enabled exclusively for xref:spark-local:spark-LocalEndpoint.adoc[LocalEndpoint] (for xref:spark-local:index.adoc[Spark in local mode]).

When created, you should see the following INFO messages in the logs:

```
INFO Executor: Starting executor ID [executorId] on host [executorHostname]
```

(only for <<isLocal, non-local modes>>) `Executor` sets `SparkUncaughtExceptionHandler` as the default handler invoked when a thread abruptly terminates due to an uncaught exception.

(only for <<isLocal, non-local modes>>) `Executor` requests the xref:spark-SparkEnv.adoc#blockManager[BlockManager] to xref:spark-BlockManager.adoc#initialize[initialize] (with the xref:spark-SparkConf.adoc#getAppId[Spark application id] of the xref:spark-SparkEnv.adoc#conf[SparkConf]).

NOTE: xref:spark-SparkConf.adoc#getAppId[Spark application id] corresponds to the value of xref:spark-SparkConf.adoc#spark.app.id[spark.app.id] Spark property.

[[creating-instance-BlockManager-shuffleMetricsSource]]
(only for <<isLocal, non-local modes>>) `Executor` requests the xref:spark-SparkEnv.adoc#metricsSystem[MetricsSystem] to xref:metrics:spark-metrics-MetricsSystem.adoc#registerSource[register] the <<executorSource, ExecutorSource>> and xref:spark-BlockManager.adoc#shuffleMetricsSource[shuffleMetricsSource] of the xref:spark-SparkEnv.adoc#blockManager[BlockManager].

NOTE: `Executor` uses `SparkEnv` to access the local xref:spark-SparkEnv.adoc#metricsSystem[MetricsSystem] and xref:spark-SparkEnv.adoc#blockManager[BlockManager].

`Executor` <<createClassLoader, creates a task class loader>> (optionally with <<addReplClassLoaderIfNeeded, REPL support>>) that the xref:spark-Serializer.adoc#setDefaultClassLoader[current `Serializer` is requested to use] (when deserializing task later).

NOTE: `Executor` uses `SparkEnv` xref:spark-SparkEnv.adoc#serializer[to access the local `Serializer`].

`Executor` <<startDriverHeartbeater, starts sending heartbeats and active tasks metrics>>.

`Executor` initializes the <<internal-properties, internal properties>>.

== [[updateDependencies]] `updateDependencies` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
updateDependencies(
  newFiles: Map[String, Long],
  newJars: Map[String, Long]): Unit
----

`updateDependencies`...FIXME

NOTE: `updateDependencies` is used exclusively when `TaskRunner` is requested to <<spark-Executor-TaskRunner.adoc#run, start>> (and run a task).

== [[launchTask]] Launching Task -- `launchTask` Method

[source, scala]
----
launchTask(
  context: ExecutorBackend,
  taskDescription: TaskDescription): Unit
----

`launchTask` simply creates a <<spark-Executor-TaskRunner.adoc#, TaskRunner>> (with the given <<spark-ExecutorBackend.adoc#, ExecutorBackend>> and the <<spark-scheduler-TaskDescription.adoc#, TaskDescription>>) and adds it to the <<runningTasks, runningTasks>> internal registry.

In the end, `launchTask` requests the <<threadPool, "Executor task launch worker" thread pool>> to execute the `TaskRunner` (sometime in the future).

[NOTE]
====
`launchTask` is used when:

* `CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend` executor backend is requested to <<spark-CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend.adoc#LaunchTask, handle a LaunchTask message>>

* `LocalEndpoint` RPC endpoint (of xref:spark-local:spark-LocalSchedulerBackend.adoc#[LocalSchedulerBackend]) is requested to xref:spark-local:spark-LocalEndpoint.adoc#reviveOffers[reviveOffers]

* `MesosExecutorBackend` executor backend is requested to xref:spark-on-mesos:spark-executor-backends-MesosExecutorBackend.adoc#launchTask[launchTask]
====

== [[heartbeater]] heartbeater -- Heartbeat Sender Thread

`heartbeater` is a daemon https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.html[ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor] with a single thread.

The name of the thread pool is *driver-heartbeater*.

== [[coarse-grained-executor]] Coarse-Grained Executors

*Coarse-grained executors* are executors that use xref:spark-CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend.adoc[CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend] for task scheduling.

== [[resource-offers]] Resource Offers

Read xref:spark-scheduler-TaskSchedulerImpl.adoc#resourceOffers[resourceOffers] in TaskSchedulerImpl and xref:spark-scheduler-TaskSetManager.adoc#resourceOffers[resourceOffer] in TaskSetManager.

== [[threadPool]] "Executor task launch worker" Thread Pool -- `threadPool` Property

`Executor` uses `threadPool` daemon cached thread pool with the name *Executor task launch worker-[ID]* (with `ID` being the task id) for <<launchTask, launching tasks>>.

`threadPool` is created when <<creating-instance, `Executor` is created>> and shut down when <<stop, it stops>>.

== [[memory]] Executor Memory -- `spark.executor.memory` or `SPARK_EXECUTOR_MEMORY` settings

You can control the amount of memory per executor using <<spark.executor.memory, spark.executor.memory>> setting. It sets the available memory equally for all executors per application.

NOTE: The amount of memory per executor is looked up when xref:spark-SparkContext.adoc#creating-instance[SparkContext is created].

You can change the assigned memory per executor per node in xref:spark-standalone.adoc[standalone cluster] using xref:spark-SparkContext.adoc#environment-variables[SPARK_EXECUTOR_MEMORY] environment variable.

You can find the value displayed as *Memory per Node* in xref:spark-standalone-Master.adoc[web UI for standalone Master] (as depicted in the figure below).

.Memory per Node in Spark Standalone's web UI
image::spark-standalone-webui-memory-per-node.png[align="center"]

The above figure shows the result of running xref:spark-shell.adoc[Spark shell] with the amount of memory per executor defined explicitly (on command line), i.e.

```
./bin/spark-shell --master spark://localhost:7077 -c spark.executor.memory=2g
```

== [[metrics]] Metrics

Every executor registers its own xref:spark-executor-ExecutorSource.adoc[ExecutorSource] to xref:spark-metrics-MetricsSystem.adoc#report[report metrics].

== [[stop]] Stopping Executor -- `stop` Method

[source, scala]
----
stop(): Unit
----

`stop` xref:spark-metrics-MetricsSystem.adoc#report[requests `MetricsSystem` for a report].

NOTE: `stop` uses `SparkEnv` xref:spark-SparkEnv.adoc#metricsSystem[to access the current `MetricsSystem`].

`stop` shuts <<heartbeater, driver-heartbeater thread>> down (and waits at most 10 seconds).

`stop` shuts <<threadPool, Executor task launch worker thread pool>> down.

(only when <<isLocal, not local>>) `stop` xref:spark-SparkEnv.adoc#stop[requests `SparkEnv` to stop].

NOTE: `stop` is used when xref:spark-CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend.adoc#Shutdown[CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend] and xref:local/spark-LocalEndpoint.adoc#StopExecutor[LocalEndpoint] are requested to stop their managed executors.

== [[computeTotalGcTime]] `computeTotalGcTime` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
computeTotalGcTime(): Long
----

`computeTotalGcTime`...FIXME

[NOTE]
====
`computeTotalGcTime` is used when:

* `TaskRunner` is requested to <<spark-Executor-TaskRunner.adoc#collectAccumulatorsAndResetStatusOnFailure, collectAccumulatorsAndResetStatusOnFailure>> and <<spark-Executor-TaskRunner.adoc#run, run>>

* `Executor` is requested to <<reportHeartBeat, heartbeat with partial metrics for active tasks to the driver>>

== [[reportHeartBeat]] Heartbeating With Partial Metrics For Active Tasks To Driver -- `reportHeartBeat` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
reportHeartBeat(): Unit
----

`reportHeartBeat` collects xref:spark-Executor-TaskRunner.adoc[TaskRunners] for <<runningTasks, currently running tasks>> (aka _active tasks_) with their xref:spark-Executor-TaskRunner.adoc#task[tasks] deserialized (i.e. either ready for execution or already started).

NOTE: xref:spark-Executor-TaskRunner.adoc[TaskRunner] has xref:spark-Executor-TaskRunner.adoc#task[task] deserialized when it xref:spark-Executor-TaskRunner.adoc#run[runs the task].

For every running task, `reportHeartBeat` takes its xref:spark-scheduler-Task.adoc#metrics[TaskMetrics] and:

* Requests xref:spark-executor-TaskMetrics.adoc#mergeShuffleReadMetrics[ShuffleRead metrics to be merged]
* xref:spark-executor-TaskMetrics.adoc#setJvmGCTime[Sets jvmGCTime metrics]

`reportHeartBeat` then records the latest values of xref:spark-executor-TaskMetrics.adoc#accumulators[internal and external accumulators] for every task.

NOTE: Internal accumulators are a task's metrics while external accumulators are a Spark application's accumulators that a user has created.

`reportHeartBeat` sends a blocking xref:spark-HeartbeatReceiver.adoc#Heartbeat[Heartbeat] message to <<heartbeatReceiverRef, `HeartbeatReceiver` endpoint>> (running on the driver). `reportHeartBeat` uses <<spark.executor.heartbeatInterval, spark.executor.heartbeatInterval>> for the RPC timeout.

NOTE: A `Heartbeat` message contains the executor identifier, the accumulator updates, and the identifier of the xref:spark-BlockManager.adoc[BlockManager].

NOTE: `reportHeartBeat` uses `SparkEnv` xref:spark-SparkEnv.adoc#blockManager[to access the current `BlockManager`].

If the response (from <<heartbeatReceiverRef, `HeartbeatReceiver` endpoint>>) is to re-register the `BlockManager`, you should see the following INFO message in the logs and `reportHeartBeat` xref:spark-BlockManager.adoc#reregister[requests `BlockManager` to re-register] (which will register the blocks the `BlockManager` manages with the driver).

```
INFO Told to re-register on heartbeat
```

NOTE: `HeartbeatResponse` requests `BlockManager` to re-register when either xref:spark-scheduler-TaskScheduler.adoc#executorHeartbeatReceived[TaskScheduler] or xref:spark-HeartbeatReceiver.adoc#Heartbeat[HeartbeatReceiver] know nothing about the executor.

When posting the `Heartbeat` was successful, `reportHeartBeat` resets <<heartbeatFailures, heartbeatFailures>> internal counter.

In case of a non-fatal exception, you should see the following WARN message in the logs (followed by the stack trace).

```
WARN Issue communicating with driver in heartbeater
```

Every failure `reportHeartBeat` increments <<heartbeatFailures, heartbeat failures>> up to <<spark.executor.heartbeat.maxFailures, spark.executor.heartbeat.maxFailures>> Spark property. When the heartbeat failures reaches the maximum, you should see the following ERROR message in the logs and the executor terminates with the error code: `56`.

```
ERROR Exit as unable to send heartbeats to driver more than [HEARTBEAT_MAX_FAILURES] times
```

NOTE: `reportHeartBeat` is used when `Executor` <<startDriverHeartbeater, schedules reporting heartbeat and partial metrics for active tasks to the driver>> (that happens every <<spark.executor.heartbeatInterval, spark.executor.heartbeatInterval>> Spark property).

== [[startDriverHeartbeater]][[heartbeats-and-active-task-metrics]] Sending Heartbeats and Active Tasks Metrics -- `startDriverHeartbeater` Internal Method

Executors keep sending <<metrics, metrics for active tasks>> to the driver every <<spark.executor.heartbeatInterval, spark.executor.heartbeatInterval>> (defaults to `10s` with some random initial delay so the heartbeats from different executors do not pile up on the driver).

.Executors use HeartbeatReceiver endpoint to report task metrics
image::executor-heartbeatReceiver-endpoint.png[align="center"]

An executor sends heartbeats using the <<heartbeater, internal heartbeater -- Heartbeat Sender Thread>>.

.HeartbeatReceiver's Heartbeat Message Handler
image::spark-HeartbeatReceiver-Heartbeat.png[align="center"]

For each xref:spark-scheduler-Task.adoc[task] in xref:spark-Executor-TaskRunner.adoc[TaskRunner] (in <<runningTasks, runningTasks>> internal registry), the task's metrics are computed (i.e. `mergeShuffleReadMetrics` and `setJvmGCTime`) that become part of the heartbeat (with accumulators).

CAUTION: FIXME How do `mergeShuffleReadMetrics` and `setJvmGCTime` influence `accumulators`?

NOTE: Executors track the xref:spark-Executor-TaskRunner.adoc[TaskRunner] that run xref:spark-scheduler-Task.adoc[tasks]. A xref:spark-Executor-TaskRunner.adoc#run[task might not be assigned to a TaskRunner yet] when the executor sends a heartbeat.

A blocking xref:spark-HeartbeatReceiver.adoc#Heartbeat[Heartbeat] message that holds the executor id, all accumulator updates (per task id), and xref:spark-BlockManager.adoc#BlockManagerId[BlockManagerId] is sent to xref:spark-HeartbeatReceiver.adoc[HeartbeatReceiver RPC endpoint] (with <<spark.executor.heartbeatInterval, spark.executor.heartbeatInterval>> timeout).

CAUTION: FIXME When is `heartbeatReceiverRef` created?

If the response xref:spark-HeartbeatReceiver.adoc#Heartbeat[requests to reregister BlockManager], you should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO Executor: Told to re-register on heartbeat
```

The xref:spark-BlockManager.adoc#reregister[BlockManager is reregistered].

The internal <<heartbeatFailures, heartbeatFailures>> counter is reset (i.e. becomes `0`).

If there are any issues with communicating with the driver, you should see the following WARN message in the logs:

```
WARN Executor: Issue communicating with driver in heartbeater
```

The internal <<heartbeatFailures, heartbeatFailures>> is incremented and checked to be less than the <<spark.executor.heartbeat.maxFailures, acceptable number of failures>> (i.e. `spark.executor.heartbeat.maxFailures` Spark property). If the number is greater, the following ERROR is printed out to the logs:

```
ERROR Executor: Exit as unable to send heartbeats to driver more than [HEARTBEAT_MAX_FAILURES] times
```

The executor exits (using `System.exit` and exit code 56).

TIP: Read about `TaskMetrics` in xref:spark-executor-TaskMetrics.adoc[TaskMetrics].
