== Spark Notebook

http://spark-notebook.io/[Spark Notebook] is a Scala-centric tool for interactive and reactive data science using Apache Spark.

This is an excellent tool for prototyping Scala/Spark code with SQL queries to analyze data (by data visualizations). It seems to have https://github.com/andypetrella/spark-notebook/blob/master/docs/widgets_viz.md[more advanced data visualizations] (comparing to link:apache-zeppelin.adoc[Apache Zeppelin]), and seems rather focused on Scala, SQL and Apache Spark.

It can visualize the output of SQL queries directly as tables and charts (which link:apache-zeppelin.adoc[Apache Zeppelin] cannot yet).

NOTE: Spark Notebook is best suited for Spark/Scala developers. Less development-oriented people may likely find Apache Zeppelin a better fit.
