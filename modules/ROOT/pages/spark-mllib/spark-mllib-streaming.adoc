== Streaming MLlib

The following Machine Learning algorithms have their streaming variants in MLlib:

* <<kmeans, k-means>>
* <<linear-regression, Linear Regression>>
* <<logistic-regression, Logistic Regression>>

They can train models and predict on streaming data.

NOTE: The streaming algorithms belong to `spark.mllib` (the older RDD-based API).
