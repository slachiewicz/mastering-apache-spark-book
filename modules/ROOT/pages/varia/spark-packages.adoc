== Spark Packages

http://spark-packages.org/[Spark Packages] is a community index of packages for Apache Spark.

Spark Packages is a community site hosting modules that are not part of Apache Spark. It offers packages for reading different files formats (than those natively supported by Spark) or from NoSQL databases like link:spark-cassandra.adoc[Cassandra], code testing, etc.

When you want to include a Spark package in your application, you should be using `--packages` command line option.
