== Spark and The Others

The *others* are the ones that are similar to Spark, but as I haven't yet exactly figured out where and how, they are here.

NOTE: I'm going to keep the noise (_enterprisey adornments_) to the very minimum.

* http://ceph.com/[Ceph] is a unified, distributed storage system.
* http://twill.incubator.apache.org/[Apache Twill] is an abstraction over Apache Hadoop YARN that allows you to use YARNâ€™s distributed capabilities with a programming model that is similar to running threads.
