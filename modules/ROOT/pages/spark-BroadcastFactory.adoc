== [[BroadcastFactory]] BroadcastFactory -- Pluggable Broadcast Variable Factories

`BroadcastFactory` is the <<contract, contract>> for <<implementations, factories>> of link:spark-broadcast.adoc[broadcast variables] in Apache Spark.

NOTE: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12588[As of Spark 2.0], it is no longer possible to plug a custom `BroadcastFactory` in, and link:spark-TorrentBroadcastFactory.adoc[TorrentBroadcastFactory] is the one and only known implementation.

`BroadcastFactory` is exclusively used and instantiated inside of link:spark-service-broadcastmanager.adoc[BroadcastManager].

[[contract]]
[source, scala]
----
package org.apache.spark.broadcast

trait BroadcastFactory {
  def initialize(isDriver: Boolean, conf: SparkConf, securityMgr: SecurityManager): Unit
  def newBroadcast[T: ClassTag](value: T, isLocal: Boolean, id: Long): Broadcast[T]
  def unbroadcast(id: Long, removeFromDriver: Boolean, blocking: Boolean): Unit
  def stop(): Unit
}

NOTE: `BroadcastFactory` is a `private[spark]` contract.
