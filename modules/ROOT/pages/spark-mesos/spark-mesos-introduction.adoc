== About Mesos

http://mesos.apache.org/[Apache Mesos] is an Apache Software Foundation open source cluster management and scheduling framework. It abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away from machines (physical or virtual).

Mesos provides API for resource management and scheduling across multiple nodes (in datacenter and cloud environments).

TIP: Visit http://mesos.apache.org/[Apache Mesos] to learn more about the project.

Mesos is _a distributed system kernel_ with _a pool of resources_.

> "If a service fails, kill and replace it".

An Apache Mesos cluster consists of three major components: masters, agents, and frameworks.

=== Concepts

A Mesos _master_ manages agents. It is responsible for tracking, pooling and distributing agents' resources, managing active applications, and task delegation.

A Mesos _agent_ is the worker with resources to execute tasks.

A Mesos _framework_ is an application running on a Apache Mesos cluster. It runs on agents as tasks.

The Mesos master _offers resources_ to frameworks that can _accept_ or _reject_ them based on specific _constraints_.

A _resource offer_ is an offer with CPU cores, memory, ports, disk.

Frameworks: Chronos, Marathon, Spark, HDFS, YARN (Myriad), Jenkins, Cassandra.

* Mesos API

* Mesos is _a scheduler of schedulers_

* Mesos assigns jobs
* Mesos typically runs with an agent on every virtual machine or bare metal server under management (https://www.joyent.com/blog/mesos-by-the-pound)
* Mesos uses Zookeeper for master election and discovery. Apache Auroa is a scheduler that runs on Mesos.
* Mesos slaves, masters, schedulers, executors, tasks
* Mesos makes use of event-driven message passing.
* Mesos is written in C++, not Java, and includes support for Docker along with other frameworks. Mesos, then, is the core of the Mesos Data Center Operating System, or DCOS, as it was coined by Mesosphere.
* This Operating System includes other handy components such as Marathon and Chronos. Marathon provides cluster-wide “init” capabilities for application in containers like Docker or cgroups. This allows one to programmatically automate the launching of large cluster-based applications. Chronos acts as a Mesos API for longer-running batch type jobs while the core Mesos SDK provides an entry point for other applications like Hadoop and Spark.
* The true goal is a full shared, generic and reusable on demand distributed architecture.
* https://mesosphere.com/infinity/[Infinity] to package and integrate the deployment of clusters
** Out of the box it will include Cassandra, Kafka, Spark, and Akka.
** an early access project
* Apache Myriad = Integrate YARN with Mesos
** making the execution of YARN work on Mesos scheduled systems transparent, multi-tenant, and smoothly managed
** to allow Mesos to centrally schedule YARN work via a Mesos based framework, including a REST API for scaling up or down
** includes a Mesos executor for launching the node manager
