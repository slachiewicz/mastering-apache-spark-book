== master's Administrative web UI

Spark Standalone cluster comes with administrative **web UI**. It is available under http://localhost:8080 by default.

=== Executor Summary

**Executor Summary** page displays information about the executors for the application id given as the `appId` request parameter.

The **State** column displays the state of an executor as tracked by the master.

When an executor is added to the pool of available executors, it enters `LAUNCHING` state. It can then enter either `RUNNING` or `FAILED` states.

An executor (as `ExecutorRunner`) sends `ExecutorStateChanged` message to a worker (that it then sends forward to a master) as a means of announcing an executor's state change:

* `ExecutorRunner.fetchAndRunExecutor` sends `EXITED`, `KILLED` or `FAILED`.
* `ExecutorRunner.killProcess`

A Worker sends `ExecutorStateChanged` messages for the following cases:

* When `LaunchExecutor` is received, an executor (as `ExecutorRunner`) is started and `RUNNING` state is announced.
* When `LaunchExecutor` is received, an executor (as `ExecutorRunner`) fails to start and `FAILED` state is announced.

If no application for the `appId` could be found, **Not Found** page is displayed.
