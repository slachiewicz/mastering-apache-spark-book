== Submission Gateways

CAUTION: FIXME

From `SparkSubmit.submit`:

In standalone cluster mode, there are two submission gateways:

1. The traditional legacy RPC gateway using o.a.s.deploy.Client as a wrapper
2. The new REST-based gateway introduced in Spark 1.3

The latter is the default behaviour as of Spark 1.3, but Spark submit will fail over to use the legacy gateway if the master endpoint turns out to be not a REST server.
