== [[ExecutorBackend]] ExecutorBackend -- Pluggable Executor Backends

`ExecutorBackend` is a <<contract, pluggable interface>> that link:spark-executor-taskrunner.adoc[TaskRunners] use to <<statusUpdate, send task status updates>> to a scheduler.

.ExecutorBackend receives notifications from TaskRunners

NOTE: `TaskRunner` manages a single individual link:spark-taskscheduler-tasks.adoc[task] and is managed by an link:spark-Executor.adoc#launchTask[`Executor` to launch a task].

CAUTION: FIXME What is "a scheduler" in this context?

It is effectively a bridge between the driver and an executor, i.e. there are two endpoints running.

There are three concrete executor backends:

1. link:spark-CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend.adoc[CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend]

2. link:spark-LocalSchedulerBackend.adoc[LocalSchedulerBackend] (for link:spark-local.adoc[local run mode])

3. link:spark-executor-backends-MesosExecutorBackend.adoc[MesosExecutorBackend]
