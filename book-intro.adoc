== Mastering Apache Spark 2

Welcome to Mastering Apache Spark 2 (aka #SparkLikePro)!

I'm https://pl.linkedin.com/in/jaceklaskowski[Jacek Laskowski], an independent consultant, developer and trainer focusing exclusively on *Apache Spark*, Apache Kafka and Kafka Streams (with Scala and sbt on Apache Mesos, Hadoop YARN and DC/OS). I offer courses, workshops, mentoring and software development services.

I lead http://www.meetup.com/WarsawScala/[Warsaw Scala Enthusiasts] and http://www.meetup.com/Warsaw-Spark[Warsaw Spark] meetups in Warsaw, Poland.

Contact me at jacek@japila.pl or https://twitter.com/jaceklaskowski[@jaceklaskowski] to discuss Apache Spark and Apache Kafka opportunities, e.g. courses, workshops, mentoring or application development services.

If you like the Apache Spark notes you should seriously consider participating in my own, very hands-on https://github.com/jaceklaskowski/spark-workshop/blob/gh-pages/slides/README.md#toc[Spark Workshops].

TIP: I'm also writing https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/apache-kafka/[Apache Kafka Notebook], https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/spark-structured-streaming/[Spark Structured Streaming Notebook] and https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/spark-streaming/[Spark Streaming Notebook].

*Mastering Apache Spark 2* serves as the ultimate place of mine to collect all the nuts and bolts of using https://spark.apache.org[Apache Spark]. The notes aim to help me designing and developing better products with Apache Spark. It is also a viable proof of my understanding of Apache Spark. I do eventually want to reach the highest level of mastery in Apache Spark (as do you!)

The collection of notes serves as *the study material* for my trainings, workshops, videos and courses about Apache Spark. Follow me on twitter https://twitter.com/jaceklaskowski[@jaceklaskowski] to know it early. You will also learn about the upcoming events about Apache Spark.
