== [[BlockTransferService]] BlockTransferService -- Pluggable Block Transfers

`BlockTransferService` is the <<contract, base>> for link:spark-ShuffleClient.adoc[ShuffleClients] that can <<fetchBlocks, fetch>> and <<uploadBlock, upload>> blocks of data synchronously or asynchronously.

[[contract]]
[source, scala]
----
package org.apache.spark.network

abstract class BlockTransferService extends ShuffleClient {
  // only required methods that have no implementation
  // the others follow
  def init(blockDataManager: BlockDataManager): Unit
  def close(): Unit
  def port: Int
  def hostName: String
  def fetchBlocks(
    host: String,
    port: Int,
    execId: String,
    blockIds: Array[String],
    listener: BlockFetchingListener,
    tempFileManager: TempFileManager): Unit
  def uploadBlock(
    hostname: String,
    port: Int,
    execId: String,
    blockId: BlockId,
    blockData: ManagedBuffer,
    level: StorageLevel,
    classTag: ClassTag[_]): Future[Unit]
}

NOTE: `BlockTransferService` is a `private[spark]` contract.

| Method
| Description

| `init`
| [[init]] Used when...FIXME

| `close`
| [[close]] Used when...FIXME

| `port`
| [[port]] Used when...FIXME

| `hostName`
| [[hostName]] Used when...FIXME

| `fetchBlocks`
a| [[fetchBlocks]] Fetches a sequence of blocks from a remote node asynchronously

Used exclusively when `BlockTransferService` is requested to <<fetchBlockSync, fetch only one block (in a blocking fashion)>>

NOTE: `fetchBlocks` is part of link:spark-ShuffleClient.adoc#fetchBlocks[ShuffleClient Contract] to...FIXME.

| `uploadBlock`
| [[uploadBlock]] Used exclusively when `BlockTransferService` is requested to <<uploadBlockSync, upload a single block to a remote node (in a blocking fashion)>>.
|===

[[implementations]]
NOTE: link:spark-NettyBlockTransferService.adoc[NettyBlockTransferService] is the one and only known implementation of <<contract, BlockTransferService Contract>>.

NOTE: `BlockTransferService` was introduced in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-3019[SPARK-3019 Pluggable block transfer interface (BlockTransferService)] and is available since Spark 1.2.0.

=== [[fetchBlockSync]] `fetchBlockSync` Method

[source, scala]
----
fetchBlockSync(
  host: String,
  port: Int,
  execId: String,
  blockId: String,
  tempFileManager: TempFileManager): ManagedBuffer
----

`fetchBlockSync`...FIXME

Synchronous (and hence blocking) `fetchBlockSync` to fetch one block `blockId` (that corresponds to the link:spark-ShuffleClient.adoc[ShuffleClient] parent's asynchronous link:spark-ShuffleClient.adoc#fetchBlocks[fetchBlocks]).

`fetchBlockSync` is a mere wrapper around link:spark-ShuffleClient.adoc#fetchBlocks[fetchBlocks] to fetch one `blockId` block that waits until the fetch finishes.

NOTE: `fetchBlockSync` is used when...FIXME

=== [[uploadBlockSync]] Uploading Single Block to Remote Node (Blocking Fashion) -- `uploadBlockSync` Method

[source, scala]
----
uploadBlockSync(
  hostname: String,
  port: Int,
  execId: String,
  blockId: BlockId,
  blockData: ManagedBuffer,
  level: StorageLevel,
  classTag: ClassTag[_]): Unit
----

`uploadBlockSync`...FIXME

`uploadBlockSync` is a mere blocking wrapper around <<uploadBlock, uploadBlock>> that waits until the upload finishes.

NOTE: `uploadBlockSync` is used exclusively when `BlockManager` is requested to link:spark-BlockManager.adoc#replicate[replicate] (when a link:spark-rdd-StorageLevel.adoc[replication level is greater than 1]).
